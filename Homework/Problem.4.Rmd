## Chapter 10, Exercise 9

### Some Basics
```{r}
states = row.names(USArrests)
names(USArrests)
```

### 9A
```{r}
clust.9a = hclust(dist(USArrests, method = "euclidian"), method = "complete")
plot(clust.9a)
```

### 9B
```{r}
clust.9b <- cutree(clust.9a, k = 3)
clust.9b
```

### 9C
```{r}
scale = scale(USArrests)
clust.9c = hclust(dist(scale, method = "euclidian"), method = "complete")
plot(clust.9c)
```

### 9D
By scaling the dendogram, we get amplify the heights, as well as turn the dendogram from having 3 main clusters to 4 main clusters. As we saw in the textbook, as the variances of Assault and UrbanPop are much higher than the others, we should, all else equal, standardize the data.
